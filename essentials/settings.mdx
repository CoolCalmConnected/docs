## Overview

Storyboard Mode transforms your script into a visual grid, showing all clips and their generated assets at a glance. It's the perfect way to review your project's visual flow and ensure consistency across scenes.

## Accessing Storyboard Mode

From any script:

1. Open your script from the dashboard
2. Click the **Storyboard** tab at the top of the page
3. Your script is displayed as a visual grid

## The Storyboard Grid

Each cell in the grid represents a clip from your script:

- **Thumbnail**: The selected asset (or placeholder if none)
- **Text Preview**: First line of the clip text
- **Sequence Number**: Position in the script
- **Status Indicator**: Shows if assets have been generated

### Grid Controls

| Control | Function |
|---------|----------|
| **Zoom** | Adjust grid size (smaller cells = more visible at once) |
| **Filter** | Show only clips with/without assets |
| **Sort** | Reorder by sequence, creation date, or status |

## Generating Assets in Storyboard

### Single Clip Generation

1. Click on a clip cell
2. The AI chat opens for that clip
3. Generate assets as normal
4. The storyboard updates with your new asset

### Bulk Generation

Generate assets for multiple clips at once:

1. Select clips by clicking while holding **Shift** or **Cmd/Ctrl**
2. Click **Generate All** in the toolbar
3. AI uses each clip's text as the generation prompt
4. Watch as thumbnails populate across your grid

<Tip>
Set a default prompt in Script Settings before bulk generation. This ensures all clips share a consistent style.
</Tip>

### Auto-Generate Prompts

Let AI write the prompts for you:

1. Select clips
2. Click **Auto-Generate Prompts**
3. AI analyzes each clip's text and creates appropriate image prompts
4. Review and edit prompts if needed
5. Click **Generate All**

## Selecting Assets

When you have multiple generated images for a clip:

1. Hover over the clip cell
2. Click the arrows to browse variations
3. Click to select your preferred version
4. The selected asset becomes the clip's thumbnail

The selected asset is what will be used if you create a video project.

## Visual Consistency

### Style Reference

Maintain visual consistency across your storyboard:

1. Generate an asset you love
2. Click **Use as Reference**
3. Future generations will match this style

### Default Prompt

Set a style prompt that applies to all generations:

```
Cinematic, 4K quality, film grain, warm color palette
```

This is appended to every generation prompt in the project.

## Creating a Video Project

From Storyboard Mode, you can create a video project:

1. Select the clips you want to include (or select all)
2. Click **Create Video** in the toolbar
3. Choose project settings (name, aspect ratio)
4. You're redirected to the Video Editor with your assets loaded

<Info>
Only clips with selected assets are included in the video project. Make sure to select assets for all clips you want to include.

## Storyboard Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review at different zoom levels">
    Zoom out to see the overall flow, zoom in to check individual assets. Both perspectives are valuable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use bulk generation wisely">
    Bulk generation is fast but uses your default prompt. For important scenes, generate individually with specific prompts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Select as you go">
    Don't wait until the end to select assets. Select your favorites immediately so you don't lose track.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check for consistency">
    Scroll through your storyboard looking for visual outliers. Regenerate anything that doesn't fit the overall style.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |

| **Arrow Keys** | Navigate between clips |
| **Enter** | Open selected clip |
| **Space** | Toggle clip selection |
