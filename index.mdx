## Why ScriptKit?

### Speed Up Your Production Workflow

Traditional video production requires extensive planning, stock footage searches, and asset creation. ScriptKit condenses this into a simple chat-based interface where you describe what you need and AI delivers.

### Consistent Visual Style

Generate multiple variations of each scene while maintaining visual consistency across your entire project. Save your favorites to the Vault for reuse across projects.

### From Script to Screen

Upload your script, let AI generate visuals for each clip, arrange them in the timeline, and export a polished video—all in one platform.
