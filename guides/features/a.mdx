## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Save early, save often">
    When you generate something good, save it immediately. You can always remove it later, but you can't recover unsaved generations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use collections consistently">
    Develop a collection system that works for your workflow. Consistent organization saves time when you need to find assets later.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tag with purpose">
    Use tags for attributes that cross collections: "approved", "needs-revision", "hero-shot", etc.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Build a style library">
    Save assets that represent your preferred styles. Use them as references for consistent generation across projects.
  </Accordion>
