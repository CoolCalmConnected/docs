## Overview

In ScriptKit, your video project is organized into **Scripts** and **Clips**. This structure mirrors traditional video production workflows while enabling AI-powered asset generation.

## What is a Script?

A **Script** is your project container. It represents an entire video project and contains all the clips, generated assets, and settings for that project.

Each script has:
- **Title**: The name of your project
- **Clips**: Individual segments of your video
- **Settings**: Default prompts, aspect ratios, and generation preferences
- **Generated Assets**: All images and videos created for this project

## What is a Clip?

A **Clip** is a single segment of your video script. Each clip typically represents:
- A line of dialogue
- A scene description
- A subtitle segment (if imported from SRT)

Each clip has:
- **Text**: The script content or dialogue
- **Timing**: Start and end times (if from SRT)
- **Sequence Number**: Position in the script
- **Generated Assets**: Images and videos for this specific clip
- **Selected Asset**: The chosen asset to use in the final video

## Creating Scripts

### Upload an SRT/VTT File

The fastest way to create a project:

1. Click **New Script** from your dashboard
2. Select **Upload Script**
3. Choose your SRT or VTT file
4. ScriptKit automatically parses it into clips with timing

<Info>
SRT files are the most common subtitle format. Each subtitle block becomes a clip with its timing preserved.
</Info>

### Start from Scratch

For projects without an existing script:

1. Click **New Script**
2. Select **Start from Scratch**
3. Enter a project title
4. Add clips manually

### AI Storyboard

Let AI help you plan your video:

1. Click **New Script**
2. Select **AI Storyboard**
3. Describe your video concept
4. AI generates a structured script outline

## Managing Clips

### Reordering Clips

Drag and drop clips to change their sequence order. The order determines how clips appear in storyboard view and the video editor.

### Merging Clips

Combine multiple clips into one:

1. Select the clips you want to merge
2. Click **Merge** in the toolbar
3. The clips are combined with their text concatenated

<Tip>
Merge short clips that belong to the same scene for easier asset management.
</Tip>

### Splitting Clips

Divide a clip into multiple segments:

1. Click on the clip to open it
2. Select **Split Clip** from the menu
3. Choose where to split the text
4. Two new clips are created

### Grouping Clips

Organize related clips into groups:

1. Select multiple clips
2. Click **Group** in the toolbar
3. Name the group (e.g., "Opening Scene", "Interview Segment")

Groups help you:
- Navigate large scripts faster
- Apply bulk actions to related clips
- Maintain organization in complex projects

## Clip Settings

### Default Prompt

Set a default prompt that applies to all generations for a clip:

```
Cinematic, 4K quality, professional lighting
```

This text is automatically appended to your generation prompts.

### Dialogue Field

For clips that contain dialogue, the dialogue field helps AI understand:
- Who is speaking
- The emotional tone
- Context for visual generation

### Aspect Ratio

Set the default aspect ratio for generated assets:
- **16:9** - Standard widescreen
- **9:16** - Vertical (TikTok, Reels)
- **1:1** - Square (Instagram)
- **4:5** - Portrait (Instagram Feed)

## Bulk Operations

### Generate All

Generate assets for multiple clips at once:

1. Switch to Storyboard view
2. Select clips (or select all)
3. Click **Generate All**
4. AI processes each clip using its text as the prompt

### Apply Settings

Apply settings across multiple clips:

1. Select the clips
2. Click **Settings** in the toolbar
3. Choose settings to apply (aspect ratio, default prompt)
4. Click **Apply to Selected**

## Script Settings

Access script-level settings from the gear icon:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Title** | Project name |
| **Default Prompt** | Base prompt for all generations |
| **Aspect Ratio** | Default aspect ratio for new clips |
| **Model Preference** | Preferred AI model for this project |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep clips focused">
    Each clip should represent a single visual scene. If a clip describes multiple scenes, consider splitting it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive text">
    The clip text helps AI understand context. More descriptive text leads to better generations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set project defaults">
    Configure default prompts and aspect ratios at the script level to maintain consistency.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Group related content">
    Use groups to organize scenes, acts, or segments for easier navigation.
  </Accordion>
