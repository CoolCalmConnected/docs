## Your First Project

### Option 1: Upload a Script

If you have an existing script (SRT, VTT, or text file):

1. From your dashboard, click **New Script**
2. Select **Upload Script**
3. Choose your file and click **Upload**
4. Your script will be parsed into individual clips automatically

<Tip>
SRT files work best because they include timing information for each line, making it easier to sync assets with your video.
</Tip>

### Option 2: Start from Scratch

To create a project without an existing script:

1. Click **New Script** from your dashboard
2. Select **Start from Scratch**
3. Enter a project name
4. Add clips manually using the **Add Clip** button

## Generate Your First Asset

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a Clip">
    Click on any clip in your script to open the AI chat interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe Your Vision">
    Type a description of the image or video you want. Be specific about style, mood, and composition:
    ```
    A cinematic wide shot of a sunset over mountain peaks,
    golden hour lighting, dramatic clouds, 8K quality
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate">
    Press Enter or click Send. The AI will generate 3 image variations for you to choose from.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select or Regenerate">
    - Click on an image to select it as your chosen asset
    - Click **Save to Vault** to keep it for later
    - Ask for modifications if you want changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Interface

### Script View

The main workspace where you see all your clips organized. Each clip shows:
- **Text**: The script line or dialogue
- **Thumbnail**: Preview of the selected asset (if any)
- **Status**: Whether assets have been generated

### AI Chat

The right panel where you interact with the AI:
- **Text Input**: Describe what you want
- **Model Selector**: Choose between different AI models
- **History**: Previous generations and conversations

### Storyboard Mode

Toggle to see your entire script as a visual grid:
- Each cell represents a clip
- See all your generated assets at a glance
- Great for reviewing visual consistency

## Working with Generated Assets

### Images

When you generate images, you get 3 variations. You can:
- **Select** an image to mark it as your chosen asset for that clip
- **Save to Vault** to keep it in your asset library
- **Regenerate** to get new variations
- **Edit** to make adjustments (remix, upscale, etc.)

### Videos

Video generation creates a 5-second clip from your prompt or from an image. Videos use more credits than images but bring your scenes to life.

```
Generate a video of waves crashing on a beach at sunset,
slow motion, cinematic
```

<Info>
Videos can also be generated from images. Select an image and ask the AI to "animate this" or "create a video from this image."
