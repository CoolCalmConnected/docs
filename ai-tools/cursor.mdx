## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is ScriptKit?">
    ScriptKit is an AI-powered video production platform that transforms your video scripts into production-ready images and videos. Upload your script, describe the visuals you want, and AI generates them for you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What file formats can I upload?">
    ScriptKit supports:
    - **SRT** - SubRip subtitle files (recommended)
    - **VTT** - WebVTT subtitle files
    - **TXT** - Plain text files

    SRT files work best because they include timing information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What AI models do you use?">
    We use state-of-the-art AI models including:
    - Custom image generation models optimized for video production
    - Google Gemini Veo for video generation

    The specific model used depends on the task and your plan.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use ScriptKit on mobile?">
    ScriptKit is optimized for desktop browsers. While the app is accessible on mobile devices, we recommend using a computer for the best experience, especially when using the video editor.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I maintain consistency across clips?">
    For visual consistency:
    1. Set a default prompt with style instructions

    4. Use the "Use as Reference" feature on successful generations
